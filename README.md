# MOVIE-RATING-PREDICTION-WITH-PYTHON

#project objective :
-i Built a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on
features like genre, director, and actors. i used regression
techniques to tackle this problem.

-The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model
that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or
critics.

-Movie Rating Prediction project enables me to explore data
analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine
learning modeling techniques. It provides insights into the factors
that influence movie ratings and allows me to build a model that
can estimate the ratings of movies accurately.
